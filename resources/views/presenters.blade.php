						Found along the Sea of Japan coast between Tokyo and Kyoto, Ishikawa is one of Japan’s 47 prefectures, centrally located on Japan’s main island of Honshu. With a rich cultural heritage handed down since the days of the samurai, the incredible natural beauty of the coastlines and mountains alike, and exceptional food made possible through this natural abundance, Ishikawa truly is full of everything you could hope for from Japan. But of course, the most special thing of all is the way that the people of Ishikawa have not only preserved their local traditions, but continue to build new forms of culture atop them as a part of everyday life. 
						Away from the tourist trail, the region is easily accessible with a direct 2-hour 30-minute Shinkansen bullet train service from Tokyo to the prefecture's capital, Kanazawa, or flights to its regional airport (Komatsu) operating from Tokyo Haneda and Tokyo Narita.
						We believe Ishikawa is the perfect place for you to discover something new and what is truly important in life.

						The Nagano Tourism Organization is a local tourism board which promotes Nagano Prefecture in Japan as a tourist destination.

						Nagano Prefecture is located in the center of Japan, not far from major cities such as Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. Surrounded by the three ranges of the Japanese Alps, it is nicknamed the “Roof of Japan”.
						
						In 1998, Nagano hosted the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, and many of the snow resorts featured in the games, namely the Hakuba Valley, Shiga Kogen and Nozawa Onsen, continue to attract winter sports enthusiasts every year.
						
						The mountains of Nagano are home not only to ski resorts and national parks, but important historical and cultural sites as well. You’ll find Matsumoto Castle, one of the oldest remaining castles in Japan; Zenkoji Temple, a center of Buddhist faith with over 1,400 years of history; and the post-towns of the Nakasendo, ancient towns once traveled by merchants and samurai.
						
						What are you waiting for? Climb the Japanese Alps. Soak in hot springs.
						Frolic with the Snow Monkeys. Slurp Soba Noodles. Slip back in time to the Feudal Past. All that and more awaits you in Nagano!					</p>

						Nobeoka City is rich in nature. It faces the Hyuga Sea, and it is fed by the Gokase River, a clear river from the Kyushu Mountains. Nobeoka was originally developed as a castle town, and it has continued developing as one of the most industrial cities in Eastern Kyushu. In 2006 and 2007, the city merged with Kitakata, Kitaura, and Kitagawa towns, making it the second largest city in Kyushu with many tourist resources. With the gradual development of the toll road network, the city has become a hub of Eastern Kyushu. The "New Nobeoka Development" is now progressing.					</p>
